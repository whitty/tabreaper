Too many tabs? It's a chore to find and click through them all to
close them. Just hit Tab Reaper, type in a URL or part of one, hit
"Close Them!" and watch them all disappear.

Features:

 - Close by URL
 - Close by Title
 - Preserve your pinned tabs
 - Choose case sensitivity
 - Close individual tabs from the list
 - Close duplicate tabs
